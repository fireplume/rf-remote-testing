Install the files in this folder on your target. The default where you should install them is /opt/robot/my-project.
If you're starting manually starting the server on the target, you might have to export PYTHONPATH as in:

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/opt/robot/my-project

so that it knows where to find the libraries.
